NEPHROLOGY REFERENCE MANUAL FOR POST-DISCHARGE CARE

SECTION 1: CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD) OVERVIEW

1.1 Definition and Stages
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work as well as they should. It is classified into 5 stages based on eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate):
- Stage 1: Kidney damage with normal kidney function (eGFR 90 or higher).
- Stage 2: Kidney damage with mild loss of kidney function (eGFR 89 to 60).
- Stage 3a: Mild to moderate loss of kidney function (eGFR 59 to 45).
- Stage 3b: Moderate to severe loss of kidney function (eGFR 44 to 30).
- Stage 4: Severe loss of kidney function (eGFR 29 to 15).
- Stage 5: Kidney failure (eGFR less than 15).

1.2 Common Symptoms
- Fatigue and weakness
- Swelling (edema) in feet and ankles
- Shortness of breath
- Nausea and vomiting
- Muscle cramps
- Sleep problems
- Changes in urine output (too much or too little)

SECTION 2: POST-DISCHARGE MANAGEMENT

2.1 Fluid Management
Patients with CKD, especially those on dialysis or in later stages, often need to limit fluid intake.
- Daily Weight: Weigh yourself every morning after urinating and before eating/drinking.
- Warning Sign: Gaining more than 2 kg (4.4 lbs) in 2 days or 3 kg (6.6 lbs) in a week indicates fluid retention.
- Edema: Check for swelling in legs, ankles, or around eyes.
- Action: If rapid weight gain or swelling occurs, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

2.2 Dietary Restrictions
- Sodium (Salt): Limit to less than 2,000 mg per day. Avoid processed foods, canned soups, and salty snacks.
- Potassium: High potassium can stop the heart. Avoid bananas, oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, and spinach if advised.
- Phosphorus: High phosphorus weakens bones. Limit dairy, nuts, seeds, and dark colas.
- Protein: Moderate protein intake is usually recommended, but requirements vary by stage and dialysis status.

2.3 Medication Safety
- NSAIDs: Avoid Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (e.g., Ibuprofen, Naproxen) as they can worsen kidney function.
- ACE Inhibitors / ARBs: (e.g., Lisinopril, Losartan) are often prescribed to protect kidneys but require monitoring of potassium levels.
- Diuretics: (e.g., Furosemide) help remove excess fluid. Take exactly as prescribed, usually in the morning to avoid night-time urination.

SECTION 3: WARNING SIGNS REQUIRING URGENT CARE

3.1 When to Call the Doctor
- Fever over 100.4°F (38°C)
- Painful urination or blood in urine
- Persistent nausea or vomiting
- Severe weakness or dizziness
- Shortness of breath that doesn't get better with rest

3.2 When to Go to ER
- Chest pain
- Severe difficulty breathing
- Mental confusion or inability to wake up
- Seizures

SECTION 4: LATEST TREATMENTS (2024 UPDATE)

4.1 SGLT2 Inhibitors
Drugs like Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin, originally for diabetes, are now standard of care for many CKD patients to slow progression, even without diabetes.

4.2 Finerenone
A non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist used to reduce the risk of kidney function decline in CKD associated with type 2 diabetes.
